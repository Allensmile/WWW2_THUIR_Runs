## Dataset

The Sogou-QCL dataset are sampled from query logs of Sogou.com. This dataset consists of 10 parts of bz2 files that are totally about 84 GB in size when compressed. To support the research of IR and other related areas, we calculated five kinds of click model-based relevance for the query-document pairs in Sogou-QCL. Each record of a query contains the text, appearance frequency and its documents, while in each document, we provided its title, content, html source, appearance frequency and five click model-based relevance. The relevance values are estimated by click models, such as TCM, DBN, PSCM, TACM and UBM, based on a large scale of query logs during April 1st-18th, 2015. Sogou-QCL can be use support a broad range of research on information retrieval and natural language understanding, such as ad-hoc retrieval, query performance predicting, and etc.
